GEN SITREP<br/>
There are some civilians that have requested evacuation and we are going
to provide them just that. They live in the farm area near Bitov and Lany 
and are waiting for our troops there. Its been reported that there are light
Russian infantry presence in the farms, so we must first clear out the area
before civilians can be airlifted out of there.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
There should be very light infantry patrols in the area, no enemy helicopters
or vehicles are reported.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the airstrip, you will be 
helicopter <marker name = 'insert'>inserted</marker> into south west of the 
target <marker name = 'target1'>buildings</marker> which you must clear. When the 
area is cleared, meet with the civilian group and evacuate them into the
helicopter using radio (0-0-1) when area is safe. Be careful what you shoot
out there, the target buildings contains innocent civilians. Do not, I repeat
do NOT fire at them. Make this one quick, clear the area, call the chopper to
pick you up and get home.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
This should be easy one. Watch what you shoot at and when all the Russians are
neutralized, meet with the civis and get them aboard the black hawk which will
bring all of you back to NATO base. Just make this quick, we do not know what
the Ivan might send to that area when you start to make noise. Good luck.
