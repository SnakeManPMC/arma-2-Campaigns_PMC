Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from airstrip. Defend it
against any Russian counter attacks.



Pink Air

GEN SITREP<br/>
NATO has foothold right in the north east edge of Nogova island now. The airstrip
which we will convert into helicopter base will serve great deal of incoming troops,
supplies and helicopters. From this airstrip we will launch attacks against the
targets in Nogova mainland.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
The NAVY ships are picking up lot of Russian radio traffic from Nogova, the traffic
peaked up after you repelled the three mechanized infantry squads. This can be mean
only one thing... more Russians coming soon.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> at the airstrip. Its your job to hold off
any possible Russian counter attacks to this facility. Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Stay sharp and expect the worst. Try to scavenge any weapons the russians have in there,
they might come useful.
<br/><br/>
