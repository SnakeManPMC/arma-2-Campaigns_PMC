Its really getting much more cloudy lately, luckily we don't get rain until
tonight, at least that what the weather guys say. So... This mission should be
easy, just need to watch my flanks, lot of open areas in north and south.

GEN SITREP<br/>
Weather starts to get worse, it will be lateron tonight when it starts to pour rain 
in so we expect to conducts todays operation in dry conditions. Todays op is assault
to the village ruins west from the NATO positions in central island.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
There are only light vehicles present in the objective, but infantry is dug in at
defensive positions mostly just waiting for us. Enemy has large base in north of the
objective which we estimate will have strong forces present. No enemy air activity
in this part of the island.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the intersection, the objective
today is the village ruins due west of your position. Attack and seize it, then set
up a defensive positions for any possible counter attack from enemy forces in the
base located due north from the objective. You mission is completed when you cleared
the ruins of enemy forces and no other troops are trying to retake it.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
As you can see outside the weather starts to grey in heavily, the weather guys told me
that todays op should be conducted in dry conditions so leave the raincoats at the base.
Light vehicles and infantry only, this is a piece of cake for you. Have fun.
