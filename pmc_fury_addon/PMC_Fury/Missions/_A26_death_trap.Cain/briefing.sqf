Alpha, Bravo and Charlie teams <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from base. 
Attack and capture the <marker name = 'target1'>enemy base</marker> in the woods.



<br/>Death Trap<br/><br/>

GEN SITREP<br/>
The closest enemy base to front lines and NATO positions is the small one in
the woods. Its extremely difficult terrain to operate, no chances of any 
armored vechiles, but in the south side there is road and Russians will most
likely drive some vehicles there.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
There is lot of infantry stationed in that base, some vehicles are also known to
be operating south of that site. No helicopters are active today.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha, Bravo and Charlie squads <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from NATO base,
assault the small Russian <marker name = 'target1'>base</marker> down in the mountain
hidden in the forest. Issue radio (0-0-1) attack call 
to <marker name = 'bravo'>Bravo</marker> who takes western route 
and <marker name = 'charlie'>Charlie</marker> with north eastern route. Neutralize all 
enemies down there. Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
More of that difficult terrain. One good point here is that you come now from the 
higher elevation and can easily shoot down towards the enemy. Use that to your 
advantage. Also be careful with the attack call.
