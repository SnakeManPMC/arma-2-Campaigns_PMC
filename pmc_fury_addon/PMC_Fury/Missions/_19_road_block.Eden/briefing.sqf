That was one hellowa ambush, the Russians didn't much expect such a warm welcome.

Road Block

We are preparing our troops to assault for city of Montignac. So we must clear out the 
narrow road passage through the woods as it is very deadly ambush point and will be used 
to reinforce Montignac in any possible attack situations.
<br/><br/>

We dont have any additional intel for the woods or road area. But its assumed the enemy 
sees this position as we do and its occupied.
<br/><br/>

You begin from <marker name = 'start'>Gravette</marker>, you are then to proceed in 
the <marker name = 'road'>road</marker> between woods. Its vital that we take control of this 
piece of road so we can cut it off and plan future ambushes. After you have cleared it, stay
alert for possible reinforcements.
