GEN SITREP<br/>
Now we got Russians attention... and anger. They have launched counter attack
to retake the positions lost in the mornings invasion. We must keep these
grounds at all cost. 
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
At this time its difficult to say whats coming, but armor and infantry is on the
move towards eastern tip of this island. Get ready for combat.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha and Bravo <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the buildings. You must
hold the <marker name = 'attack'>Russian attack</marker> back at all costs. Do not 
let them one inch of this land back. We have more troops inbound, but use what 
you have and expect the worst.
Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
