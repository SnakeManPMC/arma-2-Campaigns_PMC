My lord, that was one hair raising experience when the black hawk went down. How
nice it is to hop another bird just one day after. But hey, if I wanted safety I'd
join the bible society.

GEN SITREP<br/>
Russians had theif fun yesterday downing one of our Black Hawks, but luckily the
expert troops in the ground and special air rescue people got everyone out and
the situation was resolved. Today our operations continue with fast assault into
one of the Russian held villages, specificly Dolina in the valley. We cannot yet
occupy it as our forces need armored support and we do not have any vehicles in
the Nogova mainland yet. Russians are massing move troops into the airbase of the
island and the defenses there is estimated being extremely heavy. Looks like our
invasion must begin from somewhere else.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Dolina should still have light defenses, no enemy helicopters are reported being
operating in the area currently. We estimate that quick assault into the village
can be conducted without reinforcement making into the fight.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the airstrip, you will be 
ferried into the Nogova mainland by Black Hawk, 
the <marker name = 'insert'>insertion</marker> point is in the mountain. From there
descent into the <marker name = 'target1'>Dolina</marker> and assault it until no
Russians are left alive. When you have accomplished this, use radio call (0-0-1)
to get Black Hawk to <marker name = 'extract'>extract</marker> you from the village.
Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Am I glad to see you still in one piece. You gotta tell me every detail on that 
yesterdays mission someday when we got more time... but thats not today, this
mission is quick assault and you are supposed to be really quick. Don't get
caught into long fire fights with Ruskies as they definitely will call for 
Reinforcements.
