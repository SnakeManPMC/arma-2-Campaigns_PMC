Rescue Operation

One of our recon birds, a Blackhawk helicopter went down somewhere in south-west of 
Montignac well behind enemy lines. It is essential that we rescue the crew and destroy the 
helicopter wreckage before the enemy gets to it.
<br/><br/>

The intel bird was tasked for recon duty in the area south-west of Montignac, we do not 
know the exact location of the crash and what caused it. We have precious equipment and 
high value personell onboard that helo, it would severely hinder our operations if the 
enemy forces would get to the crash site before we do.
<br/><br/>

Our guys have crashed behind enemy lines, it is our duty to pick them up. We do not leave
men behind, no matter what is the situation. Its not something we do. Your orders are to
take UH-60 Blackhawk and fly to the <marker name = 'down'>area</marker> where the recon bird 
went down, when you find them, land and issue radio command alpha for Demolition expert 
who will demolish the downed helicopter so enemies wont have the luxury of salvaging our 
precious equipment. Dont land too close to the crashed bird so the satchels (if detonated 
while you are still on the ground) wont get you too, but dont land too far that if possible
wounded personell cant get to the rescue chopper. When all the survivors and demolition 
expert is back on board, fly to the hospital <marker name = 'hospital'>here</marker> to treat 
the wounded. When the survivors have been healed, fly them to the NATO HQ Airbase for 
debriefing.
<br/><br/>

Its up to you to rescue our boys... good luck, and godspeed son!
