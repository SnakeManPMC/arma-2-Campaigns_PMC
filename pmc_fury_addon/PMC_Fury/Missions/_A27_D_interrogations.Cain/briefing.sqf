This is the second day now. I met some bunch of young guys from Bravo squad here,
if I need to find anything good being captured, its definitely the few other
Americans I'm staying here with.<br/><br/>

They told me that the Russians are torturing in the interrogations, well I'm here
the highest ranking as I'm squad leader... when its my turn I bet there will be
some hard times for me.<br/><br/>

I was last night praying God... It felt like something I just had to do. I felt like
my whole life was presented in a quick paced movie to him, what would he think of me?
Will he condemn me for all the lifes I've taken in this war...<br/><br/>
