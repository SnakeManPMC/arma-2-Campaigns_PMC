GEN SITREP<br/>
Next objective in our war against the Russians is the town of Goisse located in 
west coast. This should not bee too heavily defended as its rather remote area in
Malden island, but its another important landmark for us to seize.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
There are some armor present in this sector but not much. Infantry is noticeable.
There seems not to be any enemy helicopter activity however.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> near Vigny, your orders are to proceed
along the coastal road into <marker name = 'target'>Goisse</marker> and capture it. While 
you do so, clear out any possible enemies that you come across. When you have neutralized
all enemies there, set up defensive pasture so that you can repel the most likely
enemy counter attack. 
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
No enemy helos, not much armor... hey this should be a piece of cake. Anyways be careful
as we are talking about the enemy front lines here. Expect anything and you'll do fine.
