GEN SITREP<br/>
Our forces performed very good yesterday in the search and rescue operation
of the downed recon helicopter. Today we launch operation to clear out 
Russian forces from the low mountain top in north east Nogova. This is the 
place almost overlooking into the only NE town in the island which we will 
be assaulting soon.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Infantry presence with maybe some BMPs at most, helicopters are not operating
in the eastern Nogova. The target area in the mountain top most likely is 
heavily defended.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> at the houses, you are to assault
and capture the <marker name = 'target1'>mountain</marker> top. Of course you must
neutralize all Russians from your stating location up to the target area. 
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
I tell you, good work yesterday. You have my respect... but you know that already
so what am I babbeling about here... OK the mountain top. They will be overlooking
you as you approach so be careful and try to sneak up on them, maybe even order
some of your guys to approach from different direction. Good luck.
