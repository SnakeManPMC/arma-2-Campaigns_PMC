Russians effected some damage to our vehicles yesterday, luckily we are still
holding the Velka Ves town. Today we are advancing towards north east where lies
the objective of Blata village.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
There are many armored vehicles in the up hills of Blata, these are mostly soft
targets. Infantry is on defensive positions.
<br/><br/>

keep the LAW guys ready.
