Engaging the Russians in the fields coming here, that was intense.
<br/><br/>

Time to Rock'n'Roll in the Regina, Yeaah!<br/>
Ok seriously I gotta be sharp here, the town is packed with Ivan boys so we really need 
to pick them off before we go charging in. Gotta keep the cool!

Alpha issued radio (0-0-1) to attack - objective is to capture city
of <marker name = 'regina'>Regina</marker> from Russians.





Regina Rock

Today we move forward with our Everon cleanup. Today we capture city of Regina in 
south-west edge of the island.
<br/><br/>

Intel estimates that the enemy forces contains at least 5-6 armored vehicles and two full
infantry squads. Our estimation has changed a bit since our last recon flight encountered
some problems. We have no indication of any enemy air operations so we have full air 
superiority over the skies. We do have some indication that Spez Natz have been operating
in the city, be alert for them.
<br/><br/>

Alpha starts north from the city <marker name = 'alpha'>here</marker> and Bravo starts bit
east from Alpha in this position <marker name = 'bravo'>here.</marker> Charlie starts from
 west of the city behind the hill <marker name = 'charlie'>here.</marker> Mission objectives
are to capture city of <marker name = 'regina'>Regina</marker> from Russians. We have Apache and
Cobra air support available.
<br/><br/>

This mission contains heavy infantry fighting in urban area. You have two other squads in
your disposal (<marker name = 'bravo'>Bravo</marker> and <marker name = 'Charlie'>Charlie</marker>) 
who will attack from your command (radio 0-0-1). We suggest that you give some time for 
the gunships to soften up the <marker name = 'regina'>target</marker> area before you proceed 
with the assault. Intel has reported that there are Spez Natz operating in the city, so you
got to be really careful with these guys, make no mistakes.
