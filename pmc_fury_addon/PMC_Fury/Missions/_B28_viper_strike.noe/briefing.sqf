GEN SITREP<br/>
There are to small villages closeby to our front line, these are Peseky and
Skalice. Today we launch operation to capture these two locations from the Russians.
We have plan underway to assault the bridge from the east side, our goal is to
get the bridge in one piece.

There are no vehicle contacts in the objectives at the moment. No helicopter activity
either. Looks like a quiet day.
