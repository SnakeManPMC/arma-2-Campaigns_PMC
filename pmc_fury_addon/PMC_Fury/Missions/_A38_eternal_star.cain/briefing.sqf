So tomorrow it starts to rain... beautiful. Well what ever works, I believe the
western technology will kick Russians good in poor weather conditions. Who knows
those NAVY F/A-18's might be helpful with the laser guided ordnance again.

GEN SITREP<br/>
The weather front thats approaching Kolgujev is much worse than the weather team 
predicted, we will get extremely heavy rains and thunderstorms. Its expected to 
arrive Kolgujev coast in the next 24 hours. We have indications that Russians are 
launching attack in the central island most likely against the base we have just 
captured. We must hold them back. The next few days will give us good indication 
of where this war is heading, the weather will make serious effect which remains 
to be seen. The area has no friendly armored vehicles because we cannot airlift
the heavies there, we must seize the roads before we can operate tanks in the central
island.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
We have lot of armor and infantry movement south and west of the target area, but no 
helicopters have been active currently. We believe enemy attack is imminent.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the base. Your mission is to defend
it against possible Russian <marker name = 'attack'>attack</marker> from S, SW at all costs. 
Today you have some support; Artillery, A-10 airstrikes and two AH-64 Apache gunships. Use 
radio to call the arty and airstrikes, Apaches operate individually. Your mission is 
accomplished when no more enemies are attacking the base. Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
We do not really know if there is anything coming at us, but be prepared for everything
the intel peeps has told us. Armored vehicles and infantry... helos they were not sure.
Keep it together there, position your men good so no Russians can flank you or get 
through the defenses. The arty is fast and decisive, the airstrikes take some time to call.
Position the airstrike target marker just N, NE of your intended target because the dumb bombs
that the flyboy is dropping will glide a bit, so make that count in your targeting. The two 
Gunship patrol selections are for you to guide the Apaches into better areas. I suggest you place
them near the enemy roads, the order is available only when helos are not engaged or 
otherwise busy.
