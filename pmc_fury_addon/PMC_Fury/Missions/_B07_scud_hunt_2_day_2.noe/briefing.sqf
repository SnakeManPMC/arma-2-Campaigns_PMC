The Russians have REALLY good defenses around here. Its going to take some
real fighting when we assault the western part. Okay the guys performed
well yesterday and I just hope we continue to have good luck today. I just
need to keep my team as stealthly as possible and avoid enemy contacts.
<br/><br/>
When we spot the Scuds, we take them out quickly and escape before Russian
patrols reach the battle point. There is not much time after the first shot
is fired and when new Russians arrive at the scene, especially those BMP's
can get there real quick when they run at full speed. Even BMP's we can handle
if there is no more than one or two, but if we get T-72 or worse, T-80's then
its totally different ballgame.
<br/><br/>
Be stealthy. Avoid enemy contact. Strike quick and escape! I need to repeat that 
to myself over and over again.
