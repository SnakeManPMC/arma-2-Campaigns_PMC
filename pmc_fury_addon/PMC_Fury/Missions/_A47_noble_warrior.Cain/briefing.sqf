GEN SITREP<br/>
It was extremely long night in the east coast but finally we stopped the Russian
forces. It came really close that they would have gotten the base, but it was
our excellent troops that once again proved themselves. We had planned to initiate
this next operation already yesterday but it had to be post poned, so today we
start to push forward in the west at our nothern front.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
The east coast road is heavily defended by infantry and tanks. Helicopters are also
being patrolling the area. 
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the east coast base, board a
black hawk in the <marker name = 'pickup'>pickup</marker> LZ. You'll be taken into
northern coast <marker name = 'insert'>insertion</marker> point. Proceed and meet with
the <marker name = 'bravo'>Bravo</marker> squad. Together you start to proceed towards
west in the coastal road. Push as far as you can, if you manage to get into
our <marker name = 'target1'>target</marker> objective, good. Artillery is available on radio 
(0-0-1) call, use it wisely. Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Use the skills you've learned in the east coast battle earlier, its most likely 
similiar situation in the northern coast road. Heavy defenses, dug in troops. Be
very careful. Use the arty to soften them up before moving ahead.
