<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>

GEN SITREP<br/>
Men and Women of the United States armed services, today we are gathering
there in the Nogova for final assault on the Russian forces in their airbase
stronghold. We have come long way since this war started on Everon northern 
beach, so many objectives met, so many friends and allies lost. But we never
hesitated for a single moment to protect the very thing that makes us so great 
and what we value so precious, our freedom. This freedom is what drives us forward,
this freedom is what ensures that each of us can live life fullfilled with 
everything we can imagine, this freeom is what separates us from the darken enemy
we are facing today. Many times before the worlds peace has dependent upon us to 
act to protect the weak and innocent, many times we have been painted as the bad
power hungry world power and yet so many times we have proven them wrong. The 
leadership has the upmost respect for the men and women of the armed forces serving
our country today, it is our honor to be here with you today, we would not give that
up for any price. We are with you, all the way. Today we witness an end of a saga, 
but before we see that end we must keep our focus, all our efforts and experience 
must come into action when we launch this operation. Operation which is called, Freedom.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Special Operations Forces have just returned from the region and they are reporting 
intense enemy forces defending the airbase. We are looking the last line of Russian
hardware including T-80's, T-72 tanks and BMP's. Infatry has well dug in there and
are waiting for our assault.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from Vidlaklov along with Charlie Abrams
tank platoon. <marker name = 'bravo1'>Bravo</marker> squad is with Delta Abrams platoon
in Petrovice. Air support today is two AH-64 Apache gunships and A-10 tank killer.
Air strikes are commenced by Alpha Black with radio call (0-0-1) and ground assault
starts with radio call (0-0-2). Our objective is to neutralize all Russians from
the <marker name = 'target1'>airbase</marker> runway and buildings. Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Hey how are you doing, nervous? nah didn't think so... today is the day, a big time 
assault and final assault I might add to the Russian stronghold. Man I have lost count
of the battles we have fought on the four islands, we have definitely come a long way.
Also I need to say that never in my military career I've had the honor to serve with 
such fine soldier and squad leader as you, make no mistake you are one of the elite 
of todays United States army. That said, make sure you get your team out alive from 
this one, its going to be real killer out there. Now lets see what we got, lot of open 
grounds and no hiding places in the desert, top of the line Russian armor and infantry 
facing us... hey, this is right in your alley? hehe! OK just make sure that you give 
good time for the gunships and fighter bombers to knock out the heaviest armor 
before proceeding.
