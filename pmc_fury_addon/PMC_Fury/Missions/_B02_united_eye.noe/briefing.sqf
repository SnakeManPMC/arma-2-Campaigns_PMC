GEN SITREP<br/>
The road along the river in central Nogova is under Russian fire from the other 
side of the river. We must conduct some airstrikes to soften up the Russian forces
in the other bank of the river. Todays operation calls infantry squads into the
east coast of Nogova, we must capture the small housing which has Russian presence.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
We don't know actually what the houses are used for, but there are Russian presence
mostly from infantry, one or two BMPs might have found their way into the area also.
No enemy helicopters are believed to be operating today.
<br/><br/>

enemy positions all the way into the <marker name = 'target1'>houses</marker> in the east

Good luck.
