Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from airstrip, assault
the <marker name = 'target1'>Mokropsy</marker> village. Maybe some better 
luck today.

GEN SITREP<br/>
It was intelligence failure yesterday that the enemy got so close, hopefully that
won't happen in the future. Today we proceed with the plan to assault Mokropsy, we
just run one day behind schedule. Also our recon teams and terrain experts are 
scouting and the Nogova for possible locations for full scale invasion. Since we
do not have any tanks and other armored vehicles in the island itself, we really
cannot hold territory for long periods of time. We like to change that.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Okay so we had small communications problem yesterday, it seems that one of our 
deep recon teams radio had malfunction and they could not get early warning to HQ
about the enemy helicopters spooling up etc. You know these things happen in war.
Todays report goes for northern part of Nogova, some more vehicles have been 
arrived and most likely some more infantry. Right now we do not have any helicopter
contacts (info 15 minutes old).
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the airstrip, you'll be 
helicopter <marker name = 'insert'>inserted</marker> in south west of the objective.
Proceed and assault <marker name = 'target1'>Mokropsy</marker> village until no
Russians are left alive. When your assault have been completed, use radio 
call (0-0-1) to call the Black Hawk to <marker name = 'extract'>extract</marker> your 
squad. Hopefully today we can conduct this operation without interferences.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Oh that yesterdays mission went belly up pretty fast, luckily it was not your 
fault at all. You did a good job in the defense. Okay today same thing as 
yesterday, hit them fast, hit them hard... and get out of there before 
reinforcements arrive into the objective. Also stay alert for any changes in the
enemy defense levels, the intel peeps have been reported more vehicles and more 
alert infantry. Good luck.
