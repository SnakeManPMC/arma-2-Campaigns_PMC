The prison camp's artillery pieces were secured from the hands of Russians, it always
is good to know that we cannot receive shit from the sky above. NATO rules the skies
and there is nothing the ruskies can do about it. No artillery, no aircrafts, nothing.
<br/><br/>

Ah well, today we have short distance to travel, no need for transport as we move to take
the enemy main base. Its good to know so much from the base as our fabulous sniper guys
are located nearby and are feeding the CO intel as much as possible. I gotta buy a drinks
for these sneaky sniper bastards! they are providing us so much cool intel.

Bravo, and Delta team will start <marker name = 'start'>here</marker> in the 
village of Levie.
<br/><br/>

Main objective is to assault and kill all Russians in the <marker name = 'base'>base</marker>
<br/><br/>

Bravo (your) team should assault from <marker name = 'alpha'>north</marker> of the base.<br/>
Charlie team will attack from <marker name = 'bravo'>woods</marker> in the west.<br/>
Delta team comes over the <marker name = 'charlie'>hill</marker> from east. Bravo uses radio
(0-0-1) to commence the attack when everybody is ready.
<br/><br/>

Supporting sniper team is located <marker name = 'sniper'>here</marker> in the edge of 
the woods.





Neutralizing enemy base

War continues and we move on. Russians are just sitting as their last attack
was repelled, there is no indications of new attacks being prepared at this time.
<br/><br/>

The enemy base just south of Levie is the biggest base the Russians have here, most
of their front line armor is maintained and refuelled there. The last attack was mainly
launched from this base. It was shame that we did not advance into this base before
the failed cease fire negotiations were initiated, we were so close. Intel estimates
that if we would have gotten this base, the Russians never could have managed to regroup
such an massive attack.<br/><br/>

We have had sniper team in the <marker name = 'sniper'>woods</marker> south-east of the base 
right after the Russian attack. They have feed us some good intel of the activity. 
Currently the base contains platoon of T-72's, one platoon of T-80's and three BMP's. 
There are two full squads of infantry stationed who seem to just wait the nevedable NATO 
attack. Usual base security is very high, there are two man patrols in the north, west and 
south sides, three man patrol in the east side hill slope (soldier and two grenadiers). 
The guard tower has sniper and machine gunner overlooking the road leading to the gate 
which has three soldiers. Anti armor team has also just moved into the compound today. 
Some sort of leadership is also present as there are two officers.
<br/><br/>

In this operation we have air support from two AH-64 Apache gunships and one A-10 Warthog. 
These guys should pretty much wipe out the enemy armor. Bravo and Delta teams start from 
the village of Levie <marker name = 'start'>here</marker> from where Delta will move to their 
attack postion <marker name = 'charlie'>here</marker> - Charlie squad comes through the woods 
from west side of the base, Charlie's attack position is <marker name = 'bravo'>here</marker>
all teams should wait until air strikes are softened up the target area. Bravo will use
radio (0-0-1) to commence the assault when ready.
<br/><br/>

When the base is secured from the Russians, mop up all the remaining forces in the immediate
area and be on alert for any reinforcement they might send. Do not wonder off the area south
of the base, we aren't yet managed to get our armor together and aren't ready for any more
advancing at this time.
