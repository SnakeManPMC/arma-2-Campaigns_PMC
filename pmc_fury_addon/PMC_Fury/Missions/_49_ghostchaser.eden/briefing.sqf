Goddamn those Spez Natz guys are one pain in the ass!
<br/><br/>

The HQ thinks we need to strike back, I think so too. They are sending their best, 
thats me. I'm going to do this one with smile on my face. PAYBACK IS A BITCH!

Find Spez Natz <marker name = 'camp'>camp</marker> and guide air strike to destroy it. You are 
to remain undetected until air strike. Then return to the <marker name = 'start'>start</marker>
 location.

You are NOT allowed to across into <marker name = 'noentry'>enemy</marker> territory surrounding
 Saint Pierre.

Good luck!

Our offensive was put on hold by the sudden Russian Special Forces attack to the airbase
and city of Morton. They caused some heavy casualties and we are now running with limited
airpower until we get resupplies from the mainland. However, this does not stop our 
advance, it only slows us a down a bit.
<br/><br/>

Intel has investigated the boat that the spez natz operatives were using attacking the
airbase (same kind of boat was used on Morton apparently). It was pure luck that the boat
had a malfunction and the team was left deserted in the beach, it could be that they would 
have been escaped totally undetected otherwise. We have reason to believe that they 
boarded the boat in the southern part of Everon, closely at the tip of the island. The 
sand and grass traces in the floor indicated so. We dont have information about the 
location of this camp (if it does even exist there), most likely scenario is that the spez 
natz are keeping low profile, hiding. Otherwise they would be using some main Russian base 
in the area. The base cannot be located near the front line, most likely it will be near 
the beach where they have good/fast access to the boats.
<br/><br/>

You are lead of the small Alpha Black team going deep into enemy territory to locate the 
hidden Spez Natz camp. Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>starts</marker> near the front lines 
in the old prison camp, where it proceeds into enemy territory to find the 
possible <marker name = 'camp'>camp</marker> of Spez Natz. You are not to across into 
the <marker name = 'noentry'>enemy</marker> territory near Saint Pierre in any circumstances. 
When you have identified the camp, you will radio the A-10 for an air stike. When the camp 
is totally destroyed, you are to proceed back 
into <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> for an extraction.
<br/><br/>

First of thank you for volunteering into this dangerous mission, it is always you guys 
that get the things done by the end of the day. I am proud of you, whatever the outcome of
this mission. Okay, you and two other soldiers are what is Alpha Black today. We do not 
want to send full squad behind enemy lines as it might caught some attention, but few guys 
can slip through quietly. This means you are to keep very very low profile when acrossing 
the <marker name = 'frontline'>front lines</marker> and while in enemy territory searching the 
area surrounding <marker name = 'camp'>this</marker> point. Fire only on self defence if 
discovered. Most likely the camp is well hidden and near the beach according to intel. Its 
is also possible that you will find multiple Russian Spez Natz operatives in there, do NOT 
try to engage them by yourself. When you have the camp 
positively identified you will use radio (0-0-1) to call orbiting 
A-10 jet to drop 2000lbs dumb bombs in the camp. This means you better not be close when 
those suckers drop, these bombs have huge blast area so get the hell out of range after 
calling the air strike. When the camp is destroyed, get back to 
the <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> point alive and yes, you are then allowed to engage 
enemies that are considered threat to your team. But of course we want to see you in the 
Officers club safely, not in a bodybag because you tried to cap some Russians behind enemy
lines returning home. So, you will be back home safely, thats an order!
<br/><br/>






<a name="identify">Identification

To identify an enemy target, you must first find it of course. Then use the binoculars
and right mouse button to identify a target. Be adviced that in most cases it requires 
several mouse clicks to identify, the more far away the target, the more clicks...
<br/><br/>

If you cannot identify target (but you can see it), then you are not close enough... 
move closer and try again. If you are already very close to the target, you can identify
it right mouse click from the weapon iron sights, or at extremely close distances with
just clicking mouse in normal view.
<br/><br/>

Why am I explaining this to you? if you can play the campaign over here, you DONT need to
get lectured on how to use this game ;)
<br/><br/>
Back to war situation
