I had a talk on the special operations forces commander in the base, he had a 
small and to quote his words easy task for which suited me. Well I'm
all for action so I volunteered immediately. S
<br/><br/>
The fast roping out of the helo is quite scary, not to mention this happens in pitch
black night in thunderstorm at enemy territory, holy smokes talk about adrenaline rush!
<br/><br/>
But its real easy, the helo pilot informs me when its time, the ropes are laid out and
then he gives me the go. Its all pretty automatic for me, just sit back and enjoy.

GEN SITREP<br/>
Our plans on attacking the southern most city ruins are in progress. The Russians
seem to have pretty good defenses there and it will not be easy task. The weather
is not showing any hope in next few days, weather team predicts that this storm
front is staying here for quite some time. 
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
You're going deep behind enemy lines. Its expected to be dangerous. We have word
that the current area you're inserting and to get extracted does not have
anti air threat.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad is stripped down for light four men, 
you <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the east coast base. Board a black hawk
in the <marker name = 'pickup'>pickup</marker> point, they will fly you deep into enemy
territory where you <marker name = 'insert'>fast rope</marker> from the chopper. Meet with
the spec ops team and give them fresh supplies. When finished proceed into the 
previously checked for safe <marker name = 'extract'>extraction</marker> point. When you 
reach it, use radio (0-0-1) to call the black hawk to pick you up. Keep it 
absolutely quiet there, this is covert ops and you are not to be seen. If you 
detect enemies, stay away from them. You are to shoot only in self defense if 
you have no other choise. For the covert nature of this mission you are to leave your
officer uniform into the barracks, go in as regular joe just in case you get caught.

TACTICAL<br/>
Damn those spec ops nutcases got you into this again? heh, ok. Well who am I to give
you any tips on this one. Good luck!
