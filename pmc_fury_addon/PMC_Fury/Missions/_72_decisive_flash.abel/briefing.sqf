Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from Cancon, proceeds and
clears the <marker name = 'beach'>beach</marker> and 
captures <marker name = 'target'>intersection</marker> in east.



Decisive Flash

GEN SITREP<br/>
We are preparing to attack Chapoi and to accomplish that we are cutting of the roads
that lead into that town. First we must clear the beach and intersection in the east
of the town.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Only infantry and few vehicles are present in the east side of Cancon at this moment.
Nothing major detected. No air activity expected.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
You <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from Cancon and proceed along the beach to clear
out any and all Russians located there. Your assigned sector is pretty much from the
hill to the coast. When you reach <marker name = 'beach'>beach</marker> you can radio in the
reinforcements which include platoon of Abrams tanks and one squad of infantry. Tanks
will stay in the beach but the infantry squad proceeds with you into the intersection. 
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Proceed along the coast, engage and kill all enemies. When you reach 
the <marker name = 'beach'>beach</marker> area use radio to call backups. Wait for the 
infantry squad and proceed with them to the <marker name = 'target'>intersection</marker> and
capture it.
