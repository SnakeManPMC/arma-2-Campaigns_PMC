Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from Fuel Station, defend it
through the night.



<br/>Night Light<br/><br/>

GEN SITREP<br/>
In the morning light we begin to push the Russians out of this island. They 
have good defensive positions in the desert which we must neutralize.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Russians are mostly on defensive. Nothing too threatening is on the scope.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> at the Fuel Station which you must
defend against anything the Russians might come up with through the night. There
is no reason to believe they will attack it, but your job is to prevent any such
operations.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Well what can I say, don't fall asleep... the helos will be patrolling the area
using night vision, so it would be highly unlikely that anything gets through to
you tonight.
