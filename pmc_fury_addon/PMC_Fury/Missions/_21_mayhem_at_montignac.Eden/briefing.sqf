Another battle won... and now we move on to the Montignac. I'm bit worried about this one,
we are up against lot of troops in this large city and it will be highly dangerous to get
into firefight inside the city. We should try to pick off the enemies from the distance
which is safe, but rather difficult. Man I wish there would be few sniper teams available.

Attack <marker name = 'montignac'>Montignac</marker> and capture it. Use radio commands
(0-0-1) for airstrike and (0-0-2) bravo squad attack command.



<br/><br/>Montignac<br/><br/>

The largest city in the central Everon, Montignac is coming under NATO attack today.
This is considered a major achievement in our campaign, as this city poses the majority
of population in the island.
<br/><br/>

Intel estimates there are significant number of enemy infantry in downtown Montignac, some
armored vehicles along with heavy tanks. There is no enemy vehicles detected in the south
of Montignac, our assault to the city will be most likely conduced without interference
from enemy vehicle reinforcements.
<br/><br/>

This attack will be started by radio (0-0-1) call to airstrikes by A-10 Warthog tank 
killers which take out the armor vehicles in the city area. Then the infantry and tanks 
move in from three directions when radio (0-0-2) is issued by Alpha squad (you). 
<marker name = 'alpha'>Alpha</marker> squad attacks from the east (Entre Deux), 
<marker name = 'bravo'>Bravo</marker> squad comes from west just outside of the city 
and <marker name = 'delta'>Delta</marker> M1A1 tank support will come from the north. Be careful
out there, its going to be one hell of a battle.
