It was incredible!<br/>
HOOYAH NATO FORCES!
<br/><br/>

The rescue operation by Special Forces was just awesome, yeah my ears were ringing
all night long after the laser guided bombs, A-10 strike and Apache gunship assault,
but holy moly it was just sweet sight to see the Blackhawks landing and Special Operations
Forces jumping out... YEAH BABY YEAH!
<br/><br/>

So now I had a good night sleep on my comfortable tent here, I again prayed God, this time
thanking him for blessing the United States of America's armed forces. Thank You.
<br/><br/>

Enough sleep... its time to get back to work.
<br/><br/>

I must find the NATO commander here somewhere so I can ask permission to get into battle 
again.
