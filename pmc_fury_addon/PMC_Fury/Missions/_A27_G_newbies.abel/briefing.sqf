It was a long trip to Malden, usually I take a nap on the Black Hawk, but not today...
I am anxious, so much so that I cannot even nap.
<br/><br/>

Wonder what kind of guys are there waiting for me, they are newbies fresh out of boot camp.
So again its my resposibility to shepherd them and keep them alive... hmm alive... could I 
have something different back in the ammo boxes... could my team still be alive and this
would have never happened?
<br/><br/>
Damn, I must stop thinking these things, there is much time for that when the War is over.
