GEN SITREP<br/>
Our operation agains the coastal city was success, we are now in control of that
city and it helps alot to bring in new supplies to the central Kolgujev. We cannot
fully trust the security of the base yet, having a supply ship on shore unloading
items when T-80's arrive is not really a good position to be in. The security of
this city is in great importance now.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
There was some helicopter activity earlier this morning, might have been some 
reconnaisance, we do not know. Armored vehicles are in the coastal road, infantry
movement has also been detected in the mountains and coastal area.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha and Bravo squads <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> at the city, main objective is
to hold off all attempts by the Russians to retake this city. We have managed to get 
vulcan AA shield into the city so you should be covered for helicopter attacks. We have
friendly <marker name = 'snipas'>snipers</marker> covering the city from high grounds.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
We have fresh supply of ammo for you, Vulcan is standing by and few tanks. Be extra careful
with the mountain ridges as the enemy would have good visuals on there. Especially snipers
can do bad things from up there. Good luck.
