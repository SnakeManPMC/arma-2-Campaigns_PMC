Another sweeping mission. Uh Oh well at least we can catch some
nice Nogovian landscape.

GEN SITREP<br/>
The area between NATO positions must be swept from any remainin Russians
before we continue forward in the south. 
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
The area between you and Bravo's position contains mostly infantry as we have
no armored contacts there. Stay alert for any fast moving vehicles though, they
could come from the south east. 
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the road. Sweep through 
the <marker name = 'target1'>area</marker> between you 
and <marker name = 'bravo1'>Bravo</marker> squad neutralizing any enemies you encounter.
Mission is accomplished when you reach Bravo's position. Good hunting.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Pretty easy sweep mission, just reach Bravos position alive and TRY to take out
as many Russians you can. Have fun.
