GEN SITREP<br/>
Our war continues on Nogova, today we will take another piece of Russian occupied
real estate, the town called Lany. There is some unconfirmed reports on Russians
setting up heavier defenses more to the north and west Nogova, the bridge is 
reported to be heavily defended already.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
You'll be facing mostly infantry, some armored vehicles. No enemy helicopters are
to be expected.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from Lipany. You are to assault the
town of <marker name = 'target1'>Lany</marker> with the road intersection. The mission
is accomplished when you have the town under control. Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Good work on Lipany operation, nicely done. Todays mission with the Lany assault 
should be pretty good if all things go well.
