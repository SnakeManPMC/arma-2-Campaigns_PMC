GEN SITREP<br/>
Our objective is to sneak behind the enemy from the north, we do not want
to engage Bludov and Modrava yet, first is the north west tip of the island.
Nobody is authorized to engage targets in the vicinity of Budlov and Modrava.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Enemy concentrations are on both objectives, infantry mostly on the hilltops and
armored vehicles on the flat lands. No enemy helos are detected in this area.
<br/><br/>

the objective one the <marker name = 'target1'>hilltop</marker> first and clear out 
all Russians. When done assault the old <marker name = 'target2'>radar site</marker> in
the high mountain. Do not engage any targets withing vicinity of Budlov or Modrava.
Go around the visual line of sight of these areas. Good luck.
<br/><br/>
