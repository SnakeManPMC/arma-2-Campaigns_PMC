Attacking Cancon in dusk.

Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the invaded beach. Proceed
and capture the following positions:<br/><marker name = 'hill'>Hill</marker><br/>
<marker name = 'buildings'>Buildings</marker><br/>
<marker name = 'cancon'>Cancon</marker>
<br/><br/>

Good luck!



<br/><br/>Distant Haven<br/><br/>

GEN SITREP<br/>
Seems like we really caught Russians off guard by our smoke and mirrors operation 
and with the invasion. Now the first russian counter attack has been defeated, we 
got few moments to breath so we are taking this opportunity and advance into 
Cancon area. This will be the first populated objective in the Malden operation. 
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
The Russian radio traffic is intense in the region right now, they seem to gather up
good counter attack forces but we have detected no heavy vehicles in the immediate area
which would be capable to launch counter attack. From the beach up to the Cancon area 
there should be nothing but infantry dug in.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha Black squad will begind from <marker name = 'start'>beach</marker> and proceeds to the
<marker name = 'hill'>hill</marker>, <marker name = 'buildings'>buildings</marker> 
 and <marker name = 'cancon'>Cancon</marker> clearing any russian infantry in the area. Make
sure that all anti armor troops are neutralized so we can freely move our tanks tomorrow.
Mission is accomplished when these three objectives have been cleared from any enemy forces.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
There should be only infantry in the objectives so you'll go with one squad, stay alert and
let no stone unturned when you proceed to clear the objectives. You have been supplied with
Night Vision Goggles just in case you need them.
