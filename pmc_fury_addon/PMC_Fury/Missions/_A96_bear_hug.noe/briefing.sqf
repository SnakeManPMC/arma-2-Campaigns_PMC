GEN SITREP<br/>
Russians are sending troops against Velka Ves in counter attack purposes,
we do want to keep this position under NATO control. We are also afraid that
they are sending the SU-25 ground attack aircraft against our forces.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
There is good possibility that you'll face SU-25 ground attack aircraft in next
few hours. They have been reported being rolled in the airbase just few moments
ago. There is enemy forces advancing towards Velka Ves from north and south. 
Combined infantry and armor.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha and Bravo squads <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from Velka Ves along
with charlie M1A1 abrams platoon. You must defend it against incoming Russians
from north and south. Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
You are looking tough stuff tonight. The truck has some stingers, use them if you
see any enemy aircrafts. Be careful with the enemy armor even as the Abrams are
pretty much handling them alone.
<br/><br/>
