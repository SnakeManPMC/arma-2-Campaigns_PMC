Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from airstrip, defend it through 
the night.



<br/><br/>Night Play<br/><br/>

GEN SITREP<br/>
Vulcans have arrived into the airstrip to provide anti air shield over the facility,
there should be no problems defeating any incoming air threats now. The only fast
option to assault this small piece of land is by air (now covered with NATO Vulcans) and
by sea on boats. BMPs can also travel in the water but they are so terrible slow that
we do not believe Russians send any more of those as it would be mere suicide for the
BMP crews and troops onboard due the slow speed. Boats can arrive rather fast but we
are setting up anti armor teams in the shore and our sniper teams are used as spotters
for incoming enemy threats. We have the ocean south of the airstrip now covered pretty 
good.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Russian helicopter radar contacts over Nogova indicate that there is air assault 
plan underway. Some vehicles are operating in the north Nogova, but its not 
certain will those be BMP's trying to assault through the ocean. No boats are 
in sight currently.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> at the airstrip which you must defend
through the night. We have Vulcans deployed in the both ends of the facility along
with additional troops and stingers. Stay lookout for BMPs or boats. Also to note,
PAPA BEAR has landed on the airstrip finally.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Good to see friendly faces in the airtstrip finally. Now its cool. OK there is ammo
boxes brought so use them as you please, the vulcans should take down any enemy helos
present but who knows what might slip through.
