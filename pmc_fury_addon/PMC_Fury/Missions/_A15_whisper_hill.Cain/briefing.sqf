Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from intersection. Clear
the <marker name = 'target1'>sniper hill</marker>
 the <marker name = 'target2'>first ruins</marker> and 
the <marker name = 'target3'>second ruins</marker> more to the south.

GEN SITREP<br/>
So far our progress is been good. We got troops in to this island and made some
advances. This advancing continues today when we proceed further into the
enemy territory.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
No armor in the target area and unknown number of infantry present. Nothing on 
radar, seems like Russians aren't flying helos today.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from intersection, you must clear
the <marker name = 'target1'>sniper hill</marker> before proceeding into
the <marker name = 'target2'>first ruins</marker> which you must capture. When that 
objective is completed, use radio (0-0-1) to 
call <marker name = 'delta'>Delta Squad</marker> commencing 
the coordinated <marker name = 'delta1'>attack</marker> into your final objective 
of <marker name = 'target3'>second ruins</marker> in the south.
<br/><br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
We can still operate freely without need to duck cover for enemy helos, great. OK
this operation seems like easy one. Shuold be ifantry only but keep your eyes open.
Coordinate the second objective attack carefully with Delta team.
