Fight like hell and defend the <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> positions, do not let
any Russians pass our front lines!




WARMONGER

Those scumsucking Russians! They have executed our negotiator cold blood. Sons of 
bitches! Now the gloves comes off, we are at full scale war and we will NOT stop until
all Russians are dead or fleeing from this island.

Intel is monitoring extremely heavy Russian armored and infantry assault to the front 
line positions, they are coming with everything they got to mobilize.

Your orders are to defend the <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> position at all costs. 
There are tank platoon and additional infantry nearby. There are ammo boxes near the 
houses in the intersection. Stay sharp, do not them get through!

Ok this is bad. The Russians killed our Negotiator and now are launching full frontal 
assault to the front line with lot of armor and infantry. We have air support on the way,
abrams platoon stationed near the buildings, besides your squad we have snipers and 
infantry in the immediate area. Additional mech squad is on the hilltop. When the shit 
hits the fan, stay low and let the air support deal with the armor first, but make sure 
any Russian infantry cannot get through either. If the situation permits, you can engage
few hundred meters to the hillside, but do not pass too far away into the enemy territory 
as this is defend and not attack mission. Good luck, seems like you're need it...
