GEN SITREP<br/>
Our scud hunt was successful, there has been no launches against our airstrip
after the Alpha squad entered into the enemy territory and took out the first
scuds. Most likely the Russians are moving the scuds into the other side of the
bridge trying to hide them there. Today we are launching assault against the
village of Mokropsy which is located in the valley in northern Nogova.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
The defenses have gotten now some armored vehicles in the northern part of Nogova
where the road system works, this includes Mokropsy. Also infantry appears to be 
more aware and waiting for possible attacks. No enemy helos are expected to be
operating in north.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the airstrip, you'll be 
helicopter <marker name = 'insert'>inserted</marker> in south west of the objective.
Proceed and assault <marker name = 'target1'>Mokropsy</marker> village until no
Russians are left alive. When your assault have been completed, use radio 
call (0-0-1) to call the Black Hawk to <marker name = 'extract'>extract</marker> your 
squad.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Welcome back sir! I believe your scud hunt was successful since we haven't seen
thos pesky things fly above us. Very very good, thank you. OK today is another
quick assault, get in and out quick. Do not leave behind looking the landscape,
the Russians will send reinforcements there which you might not be capable of
handling. So make it fast.
