GEN SITREP<br/>
Our forces performed brilliantly on the Modrova operation, now we are in control
of that city and there is no sign of enemy counter attack. This morning we start
to move more into the south, the objective is to clear out any Russians from the
road and houses just south east of Modrava.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
There is two BMP's and some trucks in the road near the houses, no enemy 
helicopters or other heavier armored vehicles present.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from Modrava, you are tasked to clear
out any Russians from the road intersection near 
the <marker name = 'target1'>houses</marker> just south east of Modrava.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
This should be easy task for you, not much of enemy defenses in that area. Just be 
careful when you kick their butts and you'll do fine.
