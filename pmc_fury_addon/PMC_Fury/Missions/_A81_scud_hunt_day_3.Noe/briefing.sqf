Yesterdays Scud hunt came up empty. Wonder if the Russians got alerted from the
first strikes and moved them into more deeper in south, dunno.
<br/><br/>
Well today we will continue more deeper into enemy territory in hunt for scuds, I'll
hope that we find some as even one scud launcher alive here to fire that damn thing 
into NATO forces would be too much to handle. Its up to me to stop these guys, I just
wish we will find rest of them...
<br/><br/>

Time to go, time to go hunting.
