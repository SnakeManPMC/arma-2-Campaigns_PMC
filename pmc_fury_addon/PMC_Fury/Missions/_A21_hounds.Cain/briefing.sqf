Two intersections or road blocks that we must seize. Should be pretty easy.

Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from base, capture
the <marker name = 'target1'>road block #1</marker> in north and

GEN SITREP<br/>
Vulcans have arrived to Kolgujev. The Russians have little surprise waiting
when they next time deploy their helicopters against our forces. Todays operation
is part of the ongoing advancement we are keeping up. Two road intersections that
control the norther part of this island must be seized under NATO control.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Enemy air operations are currently inactive due the setback they had earlier, its
unlikely to see them in 24hrs. The two road blocks are heavily defended mostly
with infantry but some armored vehicles are backing them up.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the tank base. Proceed into
the <marker name = 'target1'>road block #1</marker> and seize it. When its under
your control, we will send backup squad to relieve you when you must<br/>
attack <marker name = 'target2'>road block #2</marker> in the south. When you approach
it, <marker name = 'bravo'>Bravo</marker> squad will join you. When the second road block
have been captured, backup forces will be sent to the location. Mission is 
accomplished when the backup forces are on both objectives.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Good that we don't need to look up in the sky today. As usual proceed with caution,
don't let the enemy flank you. Watch out for snipers as they seem to make real mess
of ones day. Good luck.
