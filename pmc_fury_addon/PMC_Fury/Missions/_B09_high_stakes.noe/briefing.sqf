Aahh its good to be back in NATO base finally, three days in the western nogova
under pressure of Russian forces is indeed a refreshing experience. I'd like to
avoid such things if any way possible.
<br/><br/>
Okay so today we must climb into the highest point in Nogova, damn, thats going
to take my breath away.

Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from airstrip, assault
and capture three mountain tops:<br/>
Capture <marker name = 'target1'>mountain #1</marker><br/>
Capture <marker name = 'target2'>mountain #2</marker><br/>
Capture <marker name = 'target3'>mountain #3</marker><br/>
<br/><br/>
Good luck.



<br/><br/>High Stakes<br/><br/>

GEN SITREP<br/>
Scuds have been stopped, no more launches against our troops. Now we can only
hope that the Russians are not moving them into new firing positions, but its
unlikely that they would do so. Today our attacks proceed, the three mountain
tops in Northern Nogova is our goals, one of them being the highest point
in this island. Its a symbolic capturing if not nothing else.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Absolutely no vehicles are present in the mountain for obvious reasons. No enemy 
helicopters are operating this far in the north.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the airstrip, Black Hawk will
fly you to the <marker name = 'insert'>insertion LZ</marker> where you proceed on
foot to the objectives. Capture mountains <marker name = 'target1'>top #1</marker>,
<marker name = 'target2'>top #2</marker> and <marker name = 'target3'>top #3</marker> to 
complete your mission.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Welcome back! I assume you had fun time in the enemy territory, did you bring
any suveniers for me? Ok, today you must be careful when reaching the mountain
tops as the engagement distances get very close and one grenade from Russians
could take out half of your squad.
