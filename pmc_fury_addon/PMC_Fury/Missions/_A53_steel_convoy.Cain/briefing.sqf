Seems like an ambush mission. I must hold fire until the leading armored vehicles
are burning wrecks.

Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from base, stop the
armed <marker name = 'convoy'>convoy</marker> travelling to our base along 
the <marker name = 'target1'>road</marker> in the south.



Steel Convoy

GEN SITREP<br/>
Enemy is trying to push through our base defenses with heavy armor and troops,
its essential that we defend this base.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Seems like enemy put together somekind of armored convoy including T-80 tanks, at
least one and some infantry on Ural truck(s). No sign of enemy helicopters.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the base, your task is 
to <marker name = 'target1'>destroy</marker> the 
armed <marker name = 'convoy'>convoy</marker> heading towards our base. Bravo squad 
is your backup who will remain on the base, call them using radio (0-0-1), but 
not until you get the convoy contact. Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
OK check the ammo boxes for satchels, mines and what ever you need. Try to blast
the convoy so hard that they cannot take even one shot at you.
