GEN SITREP<br/>
Larche defenses are setting up, but no time to sit around. We move forward deeper 
into the enemy territory today. Objectives are key places north, north west from Larche.
If we manage to get that LZ operational it will give us excellent drop off point for
our troops near the front line.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Infantry and vehicles are moving in the north west side of Larche. No signs of enemy 
helicopter activity this morning.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from Larche, you are to clear out the 
first <marker name = 'target1'>intersection</marker> in the west between the hills. Secondly
you are to take the <marker name = 'target2'>mountain</marker> which we can use as site for
vulcans. Last objective is <marker name = 'target3'>landing zone</marker> or whats to become
landing zone after we seize that large open area. Mission is accomplished when all these
objectives are under NATO control. Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
I suggest using caution when going up that first road, smells like good place to set up 
ambush or at least throw couple of snipers in the hillside. Make sure the area selected
for landing zone is cleared completely, we do not want to have our choppers flying 
directly into enemy lap.
