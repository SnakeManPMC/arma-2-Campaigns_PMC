<br/><br/>
Good luck.

GEN SITREP<br/>
Today we move agains one of the biggest enemy bases in the high grounds, it contains
lot of important material from the Russians and it will help our war in Kolgujev.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
We have been monitoring infantry and armor in the base area, you should be aware that
enemy MBT's have been detected in the area.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from road, proceed and assault the big 
enemy <marker name = 'target1'>base</marker> in the mountain. When you have secured the base
keep it clear from any enemy reinforcements which could arrive from enemy territory on
west direction. Your backup today is CAS from gunship helicopter. Mission is accomplished 
when you got the base and repelled any reinfocements.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Be extra careful with the enemy armor out there. Let the CAS bird take them down if you 
encounter heavy armor. When you got the base, stay alert for those nasty counter attacks.
