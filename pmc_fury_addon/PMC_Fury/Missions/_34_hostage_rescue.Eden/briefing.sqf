We have hostage situation.<br/><br/>

The Russian prison <marker name = 'camp'>camp</marker> is where they keep the NATO soldiers as
hostages. There should not be too much of resistance on the location, but however there 
are heavy <marker name = 'enemy'>enemy</marker> presence just moments away from the camp. You
can be sure they dispatch reinforcements when you storm the camp.
<br/><br/>

You are part of the rescue squad, fly in with Blackhawk, land, grab the hostages, get back
to chopper and fly home. Make it FAST.<br/><br/>

Good luck, all of you.







POW's as hostages

Now your special rescue training comes in use. In the negotiations the Russians made it 
clear that they will only release few POW's if the NATO forces withdraw from the front.
Needless to say this is not acceptable request in any standards, the POW's are now used
as hostages and this gives us the opportunity to take action while the further cease fire 
and negotiations for ending this war are in progress. We have the full UN authority to 
rescue our forces if they are not officially POW's.<br/>
Thats the situation generically here.<br/><br/>

We have gathered intel for some time of the location of Russian prison camp where our 
two soldiers are being held. Its rather remote location on the mountain range and not 
very accessible from the ground, there are no roads. Here is the prison 
<marker name = 'camp'>camp</marker> location. There should not be too much of resistance on 
the location, but however there are heavy <marker name = 'enemy'>enemy</marker> presence due 
south from the camp. We believe that when you strike the prison camp, the reinforcements
will be sent immediately to investigate, so you do not have much time. The estimated time
of reinforcements (which are probably mechanized infantry from Durran) is only few minutes.
Needless to say, when the reinforcements arrive, you need to be long gone...
<br/><br/>

You have lightly armed and very skilled squad, specially trained for high risk rescue 
operations. Operatives are equipped with CAR-15's for high mobility, no grenades or other 
high explosives are used, so no hostages are caught in as collateral damage. Be very 
careful when shooting, there should be two hostages in the camp.<br/>
We cannot send any additional fire support for this operation because the cease fire, 
this is considered as rescue and not an offensive operation. So you are not authorized to 
use any offensive force when conducting this op. You are of course free to engage and kill 
any elements that endangers you, anyone in your team or the hostages. In fact, we endorse
you to use as much force and speed you can manage when that Blackhawk touches down on the
camp.
