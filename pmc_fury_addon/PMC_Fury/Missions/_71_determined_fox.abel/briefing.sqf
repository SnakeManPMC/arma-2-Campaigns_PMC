Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from Cancon, proceeds to the
woods and <marker name = 'target'>search and destroy</marker> all Russians.



<br/><br/>Determined Fox<br/><br/>

GEN SITREP<br/>
We are setting up for another advancement which will take place in tomorrow 
morning. Russians are definitely setting up defensive positions as we have not
been attacked heavily lately.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Unknown number of Russian infantry has been spotted by our recon sniper team. The
Russians are located in the South East tip of the woods near Cancon. The snipers 
have reported that the enemy infantry is just sitting in the woods, they are not 
moving.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Your <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> location is at Cancon where you proceed into the
SE part of the woods. <marker name = 'target'>Search and destroy</marker> all Russians in that
part of the woods. The <marker name = 'recon'>Recon team</marker> is located just north of 
the woods so watch your fire.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Be extra careful on this one. You don't have much enemies in the woods but due the 
night time and dense woods, be careful, believe me. If you wander to the north edge
of the woods, be careful not to shoot friendly <marker name = 'recon'>recon</marker> team
thats located there.
