Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from airstrip, from
the <marker name = 'insert'>insertion</marker> point hunt 
down <marker name = 'target1'>Scud</marker> launchers. Then reach 
the <marker name = 'camp'>campign</marker> point.

Good luck.



<br/>Scud Hunt 2, Day 1<br/><br/>

GEN SITREP<br/>
Seems like Russians finally got their Scuds placed into the western Nogova 
and now they are launching lot of them against us. Last night 16 American 
soldiers were killed in a scud attack to one of our army bases. We cannot 
let this happen again.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
The scuds came from western Nogova, its difficult to say excat locations as 
they are mobile launchers. However the western part is now heavily defended
and populated by the Russians, there are tanks and lot of infantry of all
kinds patrolling. Helicopters are very active there also. The airbase has
extremely heavy defenses.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the airstrip, you get Black 
Hawk <marker name = 'insert'>insertion</marker> into the beach in enemy territory.
From there proceed to search and <marker name = 'target1'>destroy</marker> for Scud 
launchers. When done searching get to the <marker name = 'camp'>campign</marker> point,
which hopefully is safe area for you to stay through the night. Do not approach
the enemy airbase. Do not engage enemies if they are not directly related to the
scud launchers. You are to avoid enemy contact at any cost, if it is scud, kill it,
if it is normal enemy patrol, steer clear from it. Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Okay another important one for you. As the orders say, keep low profile and do not
engage the random enemies unless they directly fire upon you. Maintain your 
resources, we cannot send you supplies or more men while you are there so when 
this mission begins, what you got... is what you got. Keep your men alive, do not 
waste your ammo on drive by UAZ targets. We are all counting on you. I wish you 
good hunting.
