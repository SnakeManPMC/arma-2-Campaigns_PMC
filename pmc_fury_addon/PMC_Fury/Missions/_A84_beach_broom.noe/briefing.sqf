GEN SITREP<br/>
Our invasion to Nogova is one day away, tomorrow the amphibious ships reach the 
shore line and start to deploy our tanks and other vehicles into the Nogova soil.
Today we will launch operation to prepare the beach for the invasion, there can be
no enemy forces near the invasion point tomorrow morning.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
No enemy helicopters are reported to operate in the vicinity of the objective. There
are lot of enemy activity along the south east part of Nogova, vehicles and infantry.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha and Bravo squads <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the airstrip, you are
helicopter <marker name = 'insert'>inserted</marker> to 
the <marker name = 'target1'>beach</marker> which you must clear and hold for the 
tomorrows NATO invasion of Nogova mainland. You are not allowed to proceed deeper into enemy
territory, maintain your position at the <marker name = 'beach1'>beach area</marker> and keep 
it secure. You are specificly not authorized to proceed into Okrouhlo or St. Sedlo, stay away
from these locations. Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Okay now things get hot. The beach should be easy to clear, but who knows what the
ivan sends as reinforcements... and you need to keep it clear until tomorrow morning. Also 
dont piss off the HQ by roaming deeper into Nogova, just stay on the beach.
