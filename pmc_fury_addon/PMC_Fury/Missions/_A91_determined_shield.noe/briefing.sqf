We got Lany - we defend Lany. This is how the roles change. Weird stuff.

Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from Lany, your task is
to defend it at all costs against Russian 
counter <marker name = 'attack1'>attack</marker> coming from NW.



Determined Shield

GEN SITREP<br/>
Russians apparently are launching counter attack against Lany or maybe even
Lipany. We must repel any such attacks at any cost, we do not retreat in Nogova.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
We have reason to believe that several armored vehicles and lot of infantry have 
arrived near by and most likely are launching counter attack against Lany soon.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from Lany which you are tasked to 
defend against counter <marker name = 'attack1'>attack</marker> coming from NW. There 
is ammo boxes brought to you so use them at your advantage. Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
I'd say the Russians are pissed of our advances and now they are trying to capture
some of the objectives back. Well I also believe that you will stop them, right?
<br/><br/>
