Transfer Russian POW's from the remote holding facility

While we prepare our assault to the front, we need to move some POW's from the island into
more secure holding facility.
<br/><br/>

No intel for this mission.
<br/><br/>

You are tasked to oversee POW transfer from the island into more remove holding facility.
your starting location is the <marker name = 'start'>base</marker> center of the island, you
board the Chinook helicopter backseat and ride all the way to the airbase 
to <marker name = 'pickup'>pick up</marker> the POW's. The helo will ferry them into the remote
holding facility in <marker name = 'dropoff'>this</marker> small island and drop them off. You
are then to return into the starting location on board the Chinook.
<br/><br/>

Another easy one for you, but I recommend to keep in mind what happened with the previous
prisoners of war transfer. This time we take this matter with upmost seriousness, we have
full guards in both places and armor support in the airport with helicopter gunships 
providing air cover. There should be absolutely no problems at all. You are in charge of 
the overall security of NATO and the Russians safety.
