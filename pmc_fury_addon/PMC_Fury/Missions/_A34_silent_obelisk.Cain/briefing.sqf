GEN SITREP<br/>
We must assume that the enemy is poking our defenses at night, so our troops
are there to waiting for a visit.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Lot of activity on South and South West from the captured base, but nothing 
specific is on the scope. No enemy helicopters are active at the moment.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha and Bravo squads <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> at the base which they
are tasked to guard over night. Keep your eyes open, we have nothing specific
threat coming, but it could be that the Russians are trying to retake the base.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
You have been supplied with night vision goggles, use them. Keep your eyes open
and ears listening. You might get some company tonight.
