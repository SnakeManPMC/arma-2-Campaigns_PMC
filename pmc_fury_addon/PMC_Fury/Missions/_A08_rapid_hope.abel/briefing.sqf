Alpha team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from NATO airbase. Insertion point
at <marker name = 'insert'>mountain</marker> top. Proceed through the 
NATO <marker name = 'nato'>front line</marker> and sweep to 
the <marker name = 'target1'>target</marker> area. Then move 
into <marker name = 'extract'>extraction</marker> position and call helo pickup.



<br/><br/>Rapid Hope<br/><br/>

GEN SITREP<br/>
We now use the high mobility of helicopter operations to move our personel around.
A-10's are coming later today to the airbase when we have established the final 
stronghold against any possible Russian attacks. Today We will push towards the 
northern desert wastelands, this operation commences from the NATO positions along
the west coast.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Russians are dug in at the desert, no movement detected so far. In the west coast along
the road there are mostly infantry but some vehicles might appear, difficult to see from 
the foliage.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha and Bravo squads <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from NATO airbase. The insertion
point is at <marker name = 'insert'>mountain</marker> top just south east from 
our <marker name = 'nato'>front line</marker> positions. Sweep through the enemy terrain all
the way up to the desert edge shown <marker name = 'target1'>here</marker> but do not across
it as there lays the dug in Russian heavy armor. When the sweep is complete and you are
on the <marker name = 'extract'>extraction</marker> LZ, use radio (0-0-1) to call helo pickup.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
No more walking, thats what you've been saying all along. Today you have nice helo ride
to get you going. Anyways... do not wander into the desert area, the Russian T-80's will
chew your infantry squad to pieces.
