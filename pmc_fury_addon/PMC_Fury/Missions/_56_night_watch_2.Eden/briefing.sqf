Those civis were more than happy when we freed them from the Russian captors.
<br/><br/>

Today I'm scheduled for Night Watch right next door from Russians... oh man I got a bad
feeling about this. The early war night watch is still in my memory... deep in there with 
the rest of the stuff.

Alpha starts from <marker name = 'start'>here</marker> in the Durras. Guard the city
through the night.




<br/><br/>Night Watch 2<br/><br/>

Our general plan to neutralize the last Russian forces on the island is coming together 
nicely, we are looking tough times as the city of Saint Pierre cannot just be bombed to 
oblivion, we need to surgically remove the enemy from the city. We are not prepared to go
street fighting in downtown Saint Pierre yet.
<br/><br/>

No enemy activity present, they are well dug in in their own positions. No offensive 
Russian operations are to be expected.
<br/><br/>

Alpha starts from <marker name = 'start'>here</marker> in the Durras, you are on guard duty
tonight. You are not allowed to enter into enemy territory (<marker name = 'noentry'>here</marker>
) which begins just south from Durras. You 
will <marker name = 'guard'>guard</marker> the city until morning.
<br/><br/>

This should be easy one, your orders are to guard Durras until the next morning, dont let
any Russians penetrate our defences (not to be expected), thorough the night.
