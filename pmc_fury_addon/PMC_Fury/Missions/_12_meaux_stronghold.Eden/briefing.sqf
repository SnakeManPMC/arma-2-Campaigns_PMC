Fight for Meaux

Continuing fight for the Meaux city, the Russians definitely want to have it, but we 
intend to stop them.
<br/><br/>

There are lot of enemy forces advancing to the Meaux from the south. We estimate that there 
are several armored vehicles and propably lot of infatry too. Major forces.
<br/><br/>

You have one platoon of M1A1's supporting the city, AH-1 and AH-64 are patrolling the 
skies above. You got also one sniper and the street going through city is closed. 
The direction of enemy counter attack is <marker name = 'attack'>here</marker>. Get ready for 
attack.
