GEN SITREP<br/>
Before we can set the base fully operational we must defend the Russian
attack. Plans are already underway to take the next piece of real estate
from the enemy, it would bring very solid operational area for us.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
Some vehicles and infantry is heading to the base from south. No air contacts 
detected.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha, Bravo and Charlie squads <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the base. 
Objective is simple, defend the base. Do not go wander off from the base grounds.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Ok take you positions and keep your head down, take accurate shots as the enemies
come to view. The distances are pretty close so its going to be tough fight.
