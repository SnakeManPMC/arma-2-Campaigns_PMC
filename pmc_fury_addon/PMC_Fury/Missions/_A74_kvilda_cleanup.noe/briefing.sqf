GEN SITREP<br/>
There is some Nogova civilians that are requesting evacuation as they are in fear
of the RUssian onslaught under the upcoming NATO activity. It seems that we must
do some more evacuations soon, preparations are under way. In the mean time we
will launch first quick sortie against Russian held village, it is the Kvilda 
on the coast. It the most northest Russian occupied Nogova civilian area.
<br/><br/>

INTEL<br/>
You should expect only light infantry in the area. No enemy helicopters currently
are present in the northern parts.
<br/><br/>

ORDERS<br/>
Alpha squad <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the airstrip, you will be 
helicopter <marker name = 'insert'>inserted</marker> north east of the objective.
Proceed into the <marker name = 'target1'>Kvilda</marker> village and clear our any
Russian forces present there. When done, call for black hawk extraction using
the radio call (0-0-1). Extraction point is in the objective itself, you do not
need to move after its cleared safe. Good luck.
<br/><br/>

TACTICAL<br/>
Kvilda is on the beach, our intel has good info on it so far. You'll have no
problems clearing this place up. But as always, be cautious and quick too.
